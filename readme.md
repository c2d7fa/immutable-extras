# Immutable Extras

[![NPM version badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@johv/miscjs)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@johv/miscjs)

This is just a small library with some extensions for [Immutable.js](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/). I don't really expect this to be useful for anyone other than myself.

See the source code in `src/index.ts` for API and documentation.
